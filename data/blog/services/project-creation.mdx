The major highlights of our project creation service are as given below:

1. Understand your project requirements, analyze those requirements and convert them into use cases.
2. Before starting coding, how to design software and understand various aspects of software design.
3. Organizing a project into smaller modules and understanding cohesion and coupling.
4. Coding a project: how to begin coding.
5. Understanding Static and dynamic code analyzers.
6. Use of version control system.
7. Understanding continuous integration and continuous deployment when developing a project.
8. Creating functional, unit, and integration test cases for a project.
9. Understanding Functional and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) for a project.

During their study tenure, students in IT and computer science must develop different kinds of projects. Statistically, it has been noticed that in educational institutions, students are given insufficient guidance for creating such projects. As a result, students begin to realize that they are not competent in coding, and creating projects. This can have severe implications on a student's future.

This is where our project creation service comes into play.

In addition to our project creation process, students are also given the opportunity to understand other aspects of project creation. These aspects include integrating various modules of a project, various types of testing (unit, integration, remote testing), deployment of a project, and lastly continuous integration of a project. In essence, we can say that our project creating service is a complete package that helps students in understanding various aspects of project creation.

Secondly, we also teach students about using a version control system such as git. The main reason behind this is even if someone knows how to code, if he isn't familiar with how to save the code properly for future use, coding is useless. Consequently, we have made teaching version control a key component of our project creation service. Under this, we teach students how to use git, check in - check out code, and use various git commands such as pull, checkout, push etc.

Successful software is impossible without a good design. It is quite obvious that no one can create a scalable, enterprise-level project without having a good design. According to Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare, the famous British computer scientist

"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies"

In order to accomplish this, we do not start a project directly, but rather take a deep dive with our students into its design. We ensure that students understand the underlying design ideas and the various design patterns used during our project creation.

Additionally, along with coding the functional part of a project, we also teach students about different kinds of testing. This course teaches students how to write unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests for our software.

Furthermore, we teach students how to use dynamic and static code analyzers. Students must know how to use these tools in order to get a job in big organizations such as financial institutes. Using such tools, we can protect our code from different threats. Software development has become increasingly dependent on these tools.

In conclusion, if you are looking to create a project for yourself, just enroll in our project creating service and enjoy all the above features.
