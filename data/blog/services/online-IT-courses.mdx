Nowadays, there are thousands of online information technology courses available.
Although most of these courses are satisfactory, there is one common problem.
These courses are typically recorded. Certainly, pre-recorded courses have its advantages,
but also there are quite a few serious disadvantages.
We offer synchronous online information technology (IT) courses that address these disadvantages,
making them unique and best in the market.

To begin with, when a learner has a problem during a pre-recorded class,
it can take a long time to figure out the solution because learner can only post the
question. When the learner receives the answer, it may be incomplete or just the first
step of a large problem. On the other hand, our Online IT courses live in nature,
so every class is a collaboration between teachers and students.

During our session based courses, students who are stuck have their problems solved on the spot with
minimal delay.

Another noticeable disadvantage of recorded courses is the length of these courses.
The real length of a recorded online course is far greater than the actual time that it
takes to complete the course. Keep in mind that the pace at which the practical examples
for these courses are covered is quite fast. The learner must stop recording between
lessons to match the instructor's pace. Depending on the course you are taking,
you can spend up to five to six times more time than you would have anticipated.
On the other hand, the same does not apply to live courses.

For instance, In our Live IT courses, instructor has to finish the course within a
specific time period including theory and practical examples.
Our live online IT courses are designed to be job-focused. The learner is able to appear
for job interviews within 4-6 weeks of a course.

In addition, if a student is unhappy after the first week of our course,
we provide a money back guarantee. This allows us to offer risk-free IT courses to our
students. Also, we host a special discount for needy students. We aim to help computer
science students and budding IT professionals build their professional careers.
