Our comprehensive IT Training Program gives computer science students the opportunity to learn and work on real-world projects. The duration of complete IT Training is 2-3 months.

Each day, students take a project assignment and 1 hour of teaching class. The IT training program is designed so that IT students gradually learn how to work on real-world projects.

When working on real-world projects, students not only know how to code but other aspects also such as scrum meetings, Jira, confluence, etc. In our program, we also teach these skills along with teaching how to code.

Another important aspect we cover in our IT training program is understanding various aspects of project deployment and the cloud infrastructure required for deployment. As cloud technologies have developed such as AWS, and Azure, companies not only need a software developer but also a cloud development specialist aka cloud developer.

These cloud technologies are the foundation of IT companies' strategies to speed up development cycles. As part of our IT training, we help students understand these cloud technologies, and also how these technologies speed up the development process through CI/CD.

Additionally, we also cover the use of git. According to the wiki, the definition of git is as given below:

"Git is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows."

Based on its definition, one could easily understand that knowledge of how to use Git is crucial for a developer. Writing code is possible but how to save this code for the future, where to save these code is also essential to understand. In our IT training program, we make sure that we also cover all the aspects of using git such as code check-in, resolving conflict while code check-in, creating feature branches, release branches, tagging in git, etc.

Lastly, we also provide insight into database management. How to use a relational database such as MySQL and oracle within a project. In addition to teaching how to write pl/sql queries, we also teach how to call stored procedures.

Just like our online courses, our IT training program is also based on live classes. Here in live classes, we teach students the above-mentioned topics, then they are given project work.

If a student has any question or problem related to project work, we'll discuss it in the following class. We do not move on to the next topic until the student is comfortable with the last session topics.

Now, you must be wondering, what core technologies are covered in our IT training programs and what kind of project we undertake?

After a lot of analysis and discussion among our IT professionals, we concluded that our IT training program should be based on our Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices Online Courses. However, other than covering the topics covered in this course, we will also cover the aforementioned topics. The project will also be based on this course and all the topics given in this live course will be covered thoroughly.

Don't wait to join this IT training program and become an expert in cloud engineering. If you have any other questions, please visit our contact us page.
